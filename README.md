Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Communication Networks - Discrete Event Simulator implementation

This repo contains all the assignments of the Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Communication Networks lecture to create a `Discreate Event Simulator(DES)` for communication network. Each part consists of the description of the assignment, source files and the answers of the assignment. Additionally, there is one more folder for the MAC performance analysis of slotted ALOHA using `OMNeT++`.
